      "Answer: Based on the context provided, the policy regarding drug usage seems to prohibit the unauthorized manufacture, distribution and possession of illegal or controlled substances like cocaine, ecstasy and LSD, as mentioned in [ch98-alcohol_and_drug_policy-len268.txt]. The policy also encompasses mandatory drug testing, sanctions for positive drug tests, educational programs about drug and alcohol use/misuse, and counseling [ch15-alcohol_and_drug_policy-len172.txt]. Additionally, some departments may have more stringent policies concerning prescription drugs due to the nature of their work [ch18-alcohol_and_drug_policy-len120.txt].\n"
